## Description
The DSCEngine contract is a foundational building block of the Dsce stablecoin system. Dsce is a decentralized and algorithmically stable cryptocurrency with a unique combination of characteristics, including exogenous collateral, a dollar peg, and a focus on maintaining a health factor above a minimum threshold.

At its core, DSCEngine manages the deposit and withdrawal of collateral assets, as well as the minting and burning of DSC stablecoins. It leverages a variety of external smart contracts and interfaces to achieve its goals. These include the DecentralizedStableCoin contract, which represents the DSC token itself, and the ReentrancyGuard contract for security.

One of the central concepts in the DSCEngine contract is the "health factor." The health factor measures the safety of the system by comparing the total collateral value to the total amount of DSC tokens minted. If the health factor falls below a certain threshold, it becomes possible for the system to be liquidated. Liquidation involves users redeeming collateral assets in exchange for DSC tokens to restore the system's health.

Users can interact with DSCEngine through various external and public functions. They can deposit collateral assets, mint DSC tokens, redeem collateral, and even participate in the liquidation of undercollateralized accounts. Additionally, the contract provides functions for calculating collateral values, checking health factors, and managing DSC balances.

One unique feature of the system is the ability to deposit collateral and mint DSC tokens in a single transaction, simplifying the user experience. Furthermore, the contract incentivizes liquidators by offering a 10% bonus on collateral assets obtained during the liquidation process.
 DSCEngine plays a critical role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the Dsce stablecoin system. It provides a mechanism for users to interact with the system securely while ensuring that the value of DSC tokens remains anchored to the US dollar through the collateralization of assets. This decentralized and algorithmically stablecoin system aims to offer users a reliable and transparent cryptocurrency option within the blockchain ecosystem.
